<njnmdoc title="njnmdoc - light websites" menu="MENU"  />

njnmdoc is a light text-based static site generator descending from jemdoc.
 It takes a text file written with [markdown][], an
optional configuration file and an optional menu file, and makes static websites
that look something like this one, [that one](http://cvxmod.net/) or
[another one](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/).

jemdoc was inspired by [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), which is a
text document format. AsciiDoc is great, and lots of the ideas from AsciiDoc are
copied in jemdoc. The main differences are that jemdoc is simpler (you could say
deliberately feature poor) and has more consistent syntax.

## Goals

  - Simple, consistent syntax via Markdown.
  - \\(\LaTeX\\) [ equation support](latex.html).
  - Portability. The (single) jemdoc [Python](http://www.python.org/) file +
    single css file + your input file {{&rarr;}} html.
  - Based on [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) so formatting specifics are
    independent of jemdoc.
  - Production of clean,
    [standards-compliant](http://validator.w3.org/check/referer)
    [XML 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/).
  - Minimal bells and whistles, but simple fallback to raw html if required.
