# jemdoc: menu{MENU}{index.html}, showsource
= jemdoc -- light markup
[http://stanford.edu/~jacobm/ Jacob Mattingley] ([jacobm@stanford.edu])

jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating 
websites. It takes a text file written with [example.html jemdoc markup], an
optional configuration file and an optional menu file, and makes static websites
that look something like this one, [http://cvxmod.net/ that one] or
[http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/ another one].

jemdoc was inspired by [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ AsciiDoc], which is a
text document format. AsciiDoc is great, and lots of the ideas from AsciiDoc are
copied in jemdoc. The main differences are that jemdoc is simpler (you could say
deliberately feature poor) and has more consistent syntax.

== Goals
- Simple, consistent syntax.
- $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ [latex.html equation support].
- [tables.html Table support].
- Portability. The (single) jemdoc [http://www.python.org/ Python] file \+
  single css file \+ your input file {{&rarr;}} html.
- Based on [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ CSS] so formatting specifics are
  independent of jemdoc.
- Production of clean,
  [http://validator.w3.org/check/referer
  standards-compliant] [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ XHTML 1.1].
- Minimal bells and whistles, but simple fallback to raw html if required.
