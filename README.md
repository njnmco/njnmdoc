njnmdoc
==============
*njnmdoc* is a static site generator, implemented in Python, descending
from the enduring program, `jemdoc`.

System requirements
-------------------
Python 3

(Many thanks to [Ganesh Ajjanagadde](http://www.mit.edu/~gajjanag/), who originally
made most of the changes for Python 3 compatibility.)

What's new in njnmdoc
----------------------------
- markdown
- KaTex
- configuration via python
- Python 2 support removed

Disclaimer
----------
> The focus of the implementation of the additional features was to "make them
> just work," so the implementation is suboptimal, both in terms of performance
> and style.
>
> Still, several users and I find jemdoc+MathJax is quite stable and does the job correctly :-)

True then, and true now.

README of the original jemdoc
-----------------------------
> jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating websites. It
> takes a text file written with jemdoc markup, an optional configuration file and
> an optional menu file, and makes static websites that look something like
> http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/.
>
> It was written by me, Jacob Mattingley, in 2007, and definitely isn't the type
> of code I would put on my CV. Lots of people use jemdoc, especially in academia.
